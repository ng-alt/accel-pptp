Overview
--------
The ACCEL-PPTP is PPTP client/server based on POPTOP (http://www.poptop.org) and PPTPCLIENT (http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net).
ACCEL-PPTP uses kernel module to increase performance and decrease system usage.
For more documentation about PPTP visit POPTOP web site.
ACCEL-PPTP was successfully tested on about 250 connections and system usage has been decreased by ~50% on comparisons with the
original poptop server.


Requirment
----------
1. modern linux distribution
1. kernel-2.6.15 or later with PPPOX support
2. pppd-2.4.2 or later


Insallation
-----------
Do make client_install for installing pptp client.
Do make server_install for installing pptp server.


Configuration
-------------
If you are beginner in PPTP please read documentation available on POPTOP web site.
Configuration is same as original pptpd and pptp.
Exception in configuration of client is:
replace line in peer config file (for instance, /etc/ppp/peers/my_vpn):
  pty "pptp x.x.x.x ...." 
to 
  plugin "pptp.so"
  pptp_server x.x.x.x
  pptp_phone xxxx (optional)
  pptp_window xxx (optional) - this is sliding window size (at current time automatic algorithm is not implemented),
                               set it to  3-10 for low-speed connections,
                                      to   >10 for hi-speed connections. 
  
Remove lock option in /etc/ppp/options.pptp, /etc/ppp/options.pptpd or similar if it exists.

See configuration example in example directory.


Warning !!!
-----------
The mtu/mru parametr must be less then 1437.
This driver conflicts with ip_gre driver (in kernel), so make sure that ip_gre is not built-in or loaded at run time.
Never mix connections of accel-pptp and original pptpd, before starting accel-pptp make sure that no connections
of original pptpd exists.


Kernel module
-------------
Kernel module is available as separated module and as patch for kernel.
You can use either separated module or patch for kernel.
There is only patch for 2.6.18 kernel now. If you wish patch for other kernels please mail me.
